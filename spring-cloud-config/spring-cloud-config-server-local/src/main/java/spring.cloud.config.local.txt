With a native profile, the Spring Cloud Config Server will load the configuration files from the local classpath
(or a file system configured with a spring.cloud.config.server.native.searchLocations property).
The default search locations are classpath:/, classpath:/config, file:./ and file:./config.

We will use [classpath:./config] as our configuration store location.
Create a config directory and a config-client.yaml file in it under our server projectâ€™s resources.
 Put in any arbitrary settings in the config-client.properties file.
